RoMEA is not just an award-winning 82-metre (268’4 ft) superyacht; 
it’s one of the most indulgent and luxurious charter yachts in the world, exclusively 
available for unforgettable journeys with Imperial.
 Launched in 2015
 from the renowned Abeking & Rasmussen shipyard, and 
designed by Terence Disdale, this stunning superyacht can
 transport you to your destination in absolute comfort. 
While RoMEA’s first-class crew, her celebrated chef,
 her main deck cinema room and her upper observation
 platforms are indisputably enjoyable elements of the charter experience. 
Those intent on 
pampering will particularly relish the extraordinary twin spa arrangement.
 In addition to a fully-equipped Spa on the Bridge deck,
 complete with beauty salon and massage table, the Lower deck features a 
‘Wellness Zone’ with a Finnish sauna, natural pebble flooring, a large 
Jacuzzi and a suitably restful soft-tone lighting system.
